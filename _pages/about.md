I'm Max Hill. I live in Atlanta with my wife, daughter, and two dogs. 
My programming journey started during grad school when my advisor suggest that I write code for my 
Masters thesis in... Fortran. 
Needless to say, it was a breath of fresh air when I discovered Python a year or so later. 
I've been an enthusiastic python programmer ever since.
